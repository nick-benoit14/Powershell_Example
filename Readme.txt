 Frankensense.ps1 is a sample powershell script designed to count the number of characters
 in a text file. It's primary purpose is to analyze vowel usage in the novel Frankenstein, as is
 evident in the name.

 To use Frankensense.ps1 on a seperate text file, edit $text variable found on line 36 of Frankensense.ps1
 Change value of "frank11a.txt" in  $text = ".\frank11a.txt" to read the name of your text file while leaving
 ".\" to precede the name of your text file.

 This script is a training excercise to practice familiarize myself with Powershell, as well as to provide
 the world with mission critical data, such as the number of 'A's in Frankenstein.

 Happy Trails
